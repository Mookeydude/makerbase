  <h1>About the Project</h1>
  <p> Welcom to the Makersbase! This is a project created by members of the Cape Fear Makers guild.
It was made as a way for for us to sharpen our programming and git skills. The project will light up the drawer of the item you were looking for. You can then take a specific number of the items from the drawer. You can also add an item if you want to. Feel free to contribute code to the git hub if you want!
